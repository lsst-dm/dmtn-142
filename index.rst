   We frequently do analysis in notebooks, but then the code needs to be shared in other contexts.  While it's possible to import code from notebooks, factoring shared code into libraries is a more maintainable option.  This technote lays out suggestions for best practices when writing code in a hybrid interactive analysis/shared library mode.
